# Server hosting script for Digital Ocean and Factorio
This script hosts a Droplet on Digital Ocean and starts a factorio docker server and automatically loads a specific savegame. This script can be easily modified to run other docker servers.

## Using the script
The script uses python.

Install the newest version of python on your PC.
Download the repo and unzip it. Create a virtual environment in the root folder.

on Windows
`py -m venv env`


`venv` will create a virtual Python installation in the `env` folder.

Activate the virtual environment.
You may want to enable powershell to run scripts:
`set-executionpolicy remotesigned`

Then use this
On Windows:

`.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

As long as your virtual environment is activated pip will install packages into that specific environment and youâ€™ll be able to import and use packages in your Python application. If you change or close the console the environment will be automatically deactivated. 

To install all requirements you can use

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you only need to run the script:

`python main.py`
